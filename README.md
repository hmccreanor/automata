# automata
Right now this just has conways game of life but I plan on sticking more automata type things in this repository.

## Game of Life
Controls are pretty simple. Click and drag to flip the state of cells. Press space to pause/play. Press r to kill all cells.

## Elementary Cellular Automata
Controls are the same as the Game of Life controls with the exception that the rule you wish to use must be specified as a command line argument.

## Requirements
* `python3.6`
* `pygame`
